High School of Telecommunications of Art and Technology
My birthday is on Sepetmber 11, 2000. I am 16 years old and a Junior in High school. This is going to be my 3rd year in the SOftware Engineering Program and I have a feeling that this year will be my best year in this program. I have been staying focus and on task that this class has become my favorite class out of my entire schedule. Before I was not a big fan of this program but this is due to not being entirely focused and taking this class seriously. But  as the years go by, I relaize how entirely useful this class will be later on my future. 
Schedule:
1. Gym
2. US History
3. Physics
4. Spanish
5. SEP
6. English
7. Advanced Algrebra and Trig
8. LUNCH
